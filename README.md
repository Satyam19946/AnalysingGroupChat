# Analysing Whatsapp Group Chat
Analysis of the group chat of my Whatsapp School Group 2016-2018

Downloaded the entire conversation of my Whatsapp Group.
The data consisted of ~27k messages out of which 1816 were media messages. 
Using the Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib library proceeded to extract the Message and the Name of the Sender of Each Message and then use the following lists to find who was the most active on the group. The chat and the images of the data are not posted to protect the privacy of the people involoved. 


The code can be re-used very easily.

1)Email yourself the conversation

2)Open in notepad and then change the format to utf-8 and the file extension to .csv then proceed to change the directory in the Python script.

3)This will give all the details.
